# Horce-Race-Task
Console emulation of horce race

I did some overengineering for sure  
I've implemented margin and winners picking logic pretty fast (~40-50 minutes)
and i had a lot of free time. So i decided to play with command patterns and
to implement simple console UI.
If you interested only in race logic, you can find it in folder RaceLogic.
        
Overall, i've spent ~4hrs on everything
