This test is the implementation of a [Simulates and displays the result of a horse race](https://github.com/erossini/TestForCandidate/wiki/Simulates-and-displays-the-result-of-a-horse-race).

Good structure but I don't understand why there is an `Interface` folder but interfaces are spread across the project. Tests for this project are completely missing.
